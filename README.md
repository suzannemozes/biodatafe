# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project #3: The Full Stack MERN App
Attendance

We will not be having instruction on project days, but we do expect you to be in class to work on your project and most importantly get help from your instructional team. We will not be having Office Hours.

We will still have some instruction and other mandatory items during project week.

Project Details
 
ðŸ”´ Mandatory To Pass:
MVP - Minimum Viable Product

For this project, you will be making another full CRUD app using the technologies outlined below.

    A working full-stack application, built by you, using the MERN stack: Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express and React.
    At least one model with full CRUD.

    Include at least one of the following features:

        Pull from a third party API - either client side with AJAX or server-side with an NPM
            NPMs that work with an API: Twitter, Yelp, etc. Remember the axiosmodule can make API calls server side to any URL.

        Have two models

            Have two separate models that don't have to be related
     
        Use a CSS framework like Skeleton or Bootstrap
    Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
    Use React Router

    A README.mdfile with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc
        Have a link to your hosted working app in the README.mdfile in your github repo

Submission:

You will sumbit the link to your front end repo. It SHOULD contain links to your back end repo, and both deployed apps.
